Unfortunately the compartmental models produce fractional counts at each of their time steps, including the final step.  \n\nAny ideas?

comment: MB: This class is still awaiting its class restriction. It should be restricted as being about a population that has members that are eligible for a vaccination against the members that are eligible and consented the vaccination. There is a class "eligibility rule" in OBI (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0500026), but it is restricted by definition to studies. I put in an issue in the OBI issue tracker. The consenting process and its specified outcome should be done in d-acts, but needs to be done properly.
comment: MW: I still see enough similarities at the abstract level among some control measures that we might add the concepts “Control measure compliance”, “Control measure efficacy”  and “control measure efficacy delay.”    We could then post-coordinate particular control measures such as vaccine.\n\nIt is worth noting that there are control measures such as closing schools that are not applied at the individual level.   We have not represented those control measures yet.\n

comment: MB: This class is still awaiting its class restriction. It should be restricted as being about a population that has members that are eligible for an antiviral treatment against the members that are eligible and consented the antiviral treatment. There is a class "eligibility rule" in OBI (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0500026), but it is restricted by definition to studies. I put in an issue in the OBI issue tracker. The consenting process and its specified outcome should be done in d-acts, but needs to be done properly.
comment: MW: Since the estimates that modelers use are from real populations, I have two questions:\n1. Should we distinguish between real and simulated population?\n2.  If so, do we want to represent a ‘measured’ antiviral compliance number that is a property of a real population and distinguish it from this number that we are using to study what might happen in a simulated population?\n\nMB: This issue will need to be taken care of in the axiomatization of simulated population

comment: Apollo-SV defines infection acquisition rather than infection transmission, which is the direction of movement of a pathogen in current use.  The Apollo-SV conceptualization is simpler when accounting for infections acquired from contaminated things.\nThe likelihood of acquisition is expressed by parameters such as the basic reproduction rate and transmission coefficient.   \nAn infection is acquired from an infectious organism or a contaminated thing. \n

comment: Comment from Mike (to do!):\nI checked because an infection and immunity census would involve two different census methods.   One would be some kind of disease surveillance that counts infections.  The other is some kind of immunity census process based on seroprevalence studies or vaccination registries.
comment: Equivalent class was:\n'population survey' and (has_part some \n(counting and (has_specified_output some \n(count and ('is about' some 'exposed population'))) and (has_specified_output some \n(count and ('is about' some 'infectious population'))) and (has_specified_output some \n(count and ('is about' some 'susceptible population'))) and (has_specified_output some \n(count and ('is about' some 'immune population')))))

comment: The infectious disease type in the XSD has a disease outcome element, which specifies whether someone became symptomatic, was hospitalized, etc.  All of these outcomes require some process to occur.  For sequalae of disease, it is that the realization of the disease is an etiological process that creates some other disorder.  For example, fever is often occurs because of high levels of certain interleukins (which is a disorder).\n\nSo I am comfortable with disease outcome as a process.  It is also consistent with the probabilitistic information that will go with it, as a future probability is almost always (if not always) the probability of some event occurring (e.g., coin turning up heads, raining, developing a disease),

comment: Because a set A is a subset of itself, we capture the possibility that all infected organisms in the epidemic are represented in the tree.
comment: This definition allows for multiple trees in an epidemic because we did not require that the first case infected temporally be the index case, although the ideal situation is that there is one tree for the epidemic that includes the index case.

comment: We often say in natural language it is the efficacy of the triggering planned process such as vaccination. However, processes do not have properties such as roles, dispositions, functions, qualities in BFO. And this is also not a process profile, because it is not the process of a quality changing values (determinates) over time. Nevertheless, it is natural to classify efficacies based on the type of triggering process because that is what differentiates what happens when they are realized. For example, a vaccination efficacy will be realized through different processes than a quarantine efficacy. For individual treatments, the triggering process is a treatment (as defined by OGMS).

comment: Source code can be automatically generated to some extent, but we're assuming humans still curate it minimally. Also, in the case of Java and its JVM, it's machine interpretable instructions, not directly executable. Ditto for other languages with intermediate form like Java byte code.

comment: Legally, this covers the situation of a parent intending to have their child vaccinated. That is because the parent(s) is(are) the natural gaurdian of the child. Other individuals appointed by a court as guardian are legal guardians. If the specific case of parent / child is required, we could create a subclass of this one where the guardian = parent of the ward, and ward = child. However, that could get into issues of adoption, etc.  At the current time we do not have guardian role and ward role classes in OMRSE.

comment: The case of adult children is eliminated through the use of guardian and ward roles in the definition. The parent no longer has a guardian role, and the child no longer has a ward role, once the child is of legal age to make their own decisions. That is, those roles cease to exist.
