Unfortunately the compartmental models produce fractional counts at each of their time steps, including the final step.  \n\nAny ideas?

comment: MB: This class is still awaiting its class restriction. It should be restricted as being about a population that has members that are eligible for a vaccination against the members that are eligible and consented the vaccination. There is a class "eligibility rule" in OBI (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0500026), but it is restricted by definition to studies. I put in an issue in the OBI issue tracker. The consenting process and its specified outcome should be done in d-acts, but needs to be done properly.
comment: MW: I still see enough similarities at the abstract level among some control measures that we might add the concepts “Control measure compliance”, “Control measure efficacy”  and “control measure efficacy delay.”    We could then post-coordinate particular control measures such as vaccine.\n\nIt is worth noting that there are control measures such as closing schools that are not applied at the individual level.   We have not represented those control measures yet.\n

comment: MB: This class is still awaiting its class restriction. It should be restricted as being about a population that has members that are eligible for an antiviral treatment against the members that are eligible and consented the antiviral treatment. There is a class "eligibility rule" in OBI (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0500026), but it is restricted by definition to studies. I put in an issue in the OBI issue tracker. The consenting process and its specified outcome should be done in d-acts, but needs to be done properly.
comment: MW: Since the estimates that modelers use are from real populations, I have two questions:\n1. Should we distinguish between real and simulated population?\n2.  If so, do we want to represent a ‘measured’ antiviral compliance number that is a property of a real population and distinguish it from this number that we are using to study what might happen in a simulated population?\n\nMB: This issue will need to be taken care of in the axiomatization of simulated population

comment: Apollo-SV defines infection acquisition rather than infection transmission, which is the direction of movement of a pathogen in current use.  The Apollo-SV conceptualization is simpler when accounting for infections acquired from contaminated things.\nThe likelihood of acquisition is expressed by parameters such as the basic reproduction rate and transmission coefficient.   \nAn infection is acquired from an infectious organism or a contaminated thing. \n

comment: Comment from Mike (to do!):\nI checked because an infection and immunity census would involve two different census methods.   One would be some kind of disease surveillance that counts infections.  The other is some kind of immunity census process based on seroprevalence studies or vaccination registries.
comment: Equivalent class was:\n'population survey' and (has_part some \n(counting and (has_specified_output some \n(count and ('is about' some 'exposed population'))) and (has_specified_output some \n(count and ('is about' some 'infectious population'))) and (has_specified_output some \n(count and ('is about' some 'susceptible population'))) and (has_specified_output some \n(count and ('is about' some 'immune population')))))

comment: The infectious disease type in the XSD has a disease outcome element, which specifies whether someone became symptomatic, was hospitalized, etc.  All of these outcomes require some process to occur.  For sequalae of disease, it is that the realization of the disease is an etiological process that creates some other disorder.  For example, fever is often occurs because of high levels of certain interleukins (which is a disorder).\n\nSo I am comfortable with disease outcome as a process.  It is also consistent with the probabilitistic information that will go with it, as a future probability is almost always (if not always) the probability of some event occurring (e.g., coin turning up heads, raining, developing a disease),

comment: This definition allows for multiple trees in an epidemic because we did not require that the first case infected temporally be the index case, although the ideal situation is that there is one tree for the epidemic that includes the index case.

comment: We often say in natural language it is the efficacy of the triggering planned process such as vaccination. However, processes do not have properties such as roles, dispositions, functions, qualities in BFO. And this is also not a process profile, because it is not the process of a quality changing values (determinates) over time. Nevertheless, it is natural to classify efficacies based on the type of triggering process because that is what differentiates what happens when they are realized. For example, a vaccination efficacy will be realized through different processes than a quarantine efficacy. For individual treatments, the triggering process is a treatment (as defined by OGMS).

comment: Source code can be automatically generated to some extent, but we're assuming humans still curate it minimally. Also, in the case of Java and its JVM, it's machine interpretable instructions, not directly executable. Ditto for other languages with intermediate form like Java byte code.

Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops. The division of portions of reality into units is one starting point for the phenomenon of counting." xsd:string

Material entities with no proper material parts would satisfy these conditions trivially. Candidate examples of types of causal unity for material entities of more complex sorts are as follows (this is not intended to be an exhaustive list):CU1: Causal unity via physical coveringHere the parts in the interior of the unified entity are combined together causally through a common membrane or other physical covering\\.

[]
comment: Includes atmosphere, crust, geographical regions (e.g., the geographical region over which the state of Florida has jurisdiction), bodies of water, mountains, etc.\n\nGenerally, an individual organism is a distinct object that is not a part of the Earth, although this requires more thought.  But the intent is definitely for this class to NOT subsume organism universally.  Human beings are contained within, but not part of, the Earth, for example.
comment: Note that despite the word 'planetary' in 'planetary surface', it refers generally to surface of dwarf planets, asteroids, moons, etc.
comment: We note that not all planets have a surface per se (e.g., gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn).  So only planets, natural satellites, etc. with a planetary surface (with or without a planetary boundary layer) have geographical entities.
comment: We note that the term 'geography' is also applied to the Earth's moon, Mars, Venus, and possibly even other moons and planets in our own solar system and beyond.  \n\nThus, we are attempting to define things generally enough that they could be reused for the geographical entities/features on the Moon, Mars, other planets, exoplanets, other natural satellites (a.k.a moons), asteroids, etc.

name: de jure sovereign state
def: "A sovereign state whose political sovereignty has been recognized by the United Nations, in accordance with international law." []
comment: Sovereignty, in the legal sense, is acquired by a state upon receiving recognition by the international community. However, without specifying that this recognition can only be acquired through full membership to the United Nations, a non-arbitrary standard would be difficult, if not impossible, to come by since there are a good many sovereign states whose sovereignty is not explicitly recognized by one or more states. Given that the de facto criteria for sovereignty must be achieved prior to membership to the UN General Assembly and that every member therein is considered to be "international recognized," full membership to the UN is a sufficient criterion for de jure sovereignty. This can be further justified by noting that, in cases where UN member X claims to not recognize the sovereign status of UN member Y, the diplomatic and political behavior of member X towards Y nevertheless tacitly implies that it recognizes Y's sovereignty.

Even knowledgeable and experienced scientists can benefit from computational tools that help navigate this vast and rapidly evolving terrain. In this paper, we describe a novel computational approach to this challenge, a knowledge-based system that combines reading, reasoning and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. Reading methods extract information from external resources, either by parsing structured data or biomedical language processing to extract information from unstructured data, and track knowledge provenance.  Reasoning methods enrich the knowledge that results from reading by, for example, noting two genes that are annotated to the same ontology term or database entry.  Reasoning is also used to combine all sources into a knowledge network that represents the integration of all sorts of relationships between a pair of genes, and to calculate a combined reliability score. Reporting methods combine the knowledge network with a congruent network constructed from experimental data and visualize the combined network in a tool that facilitates the knowledge-based analysis of that data." xsd:string

These studies require additional functional evaluation of candidate genes, including their possible interaction with diet and environment. The number of candidate genes is typically large and the development of appropriate genetic tools in mammalian systems is slow. By contrast, large-scale genetic screens, using widely available genetic tools, are routinely conducted in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we used Drosophila to screen candidate genes identified in human genome-wide scans as associated with risk of metabolic abnormalities such as type 2 diabetes. We show that a number of human candidate genes have fly orthologs that play an important role in Drosophila tolerance to high dietary sucrose. We further explored some of the specific metabolic abnormalities that can result when these genes’ activities are reduced in flies, focusing on a gene we call dHHEX (CG7056), the fly ortholog of human HHEX." xsd:string

comment: Personal names "today usually comprises a given name bestowed at birth or at a young age plus a surname. It is nearly universal for a human to have a name; except in rare cases, for example feral children growing up in isolation, or infants orphaned by natural disaster for whom no written record survives.[citation needed] The Convention on the Rights of the Child specifies that a child has the right from birth to a name. Certain isolated tribes, such as the Machiguenga of the Amazon, also lack personal names." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_name)
comment: Personal names to not include names of fictional characters, e.g. Sherlock Holmes.
comment: Sep 29, 2016: The comment that including the wikipedia definition of personal name is not to be interpreted in a way that restricts this class to only contain strings of letters. A numerical or alphanumerical identifier that denotes a human is being is a personal name, too. (MB)

comment: Does not imply that identifiers denote particulars, universals, or defined classes (a.k.a. attributive collections) or even that they denote only one of these three types of entities (e.g., SNOMED and even various OBO ontologies have identifiers that identify entities in all three categories).
comment: Each aggregated entity is often (but not necessarily) associated with a text string—variously called a “description,” “name,” “title,” or “label”—that helps humans reach the target of denotation.\n\nWhen there is no such string, it is almost always because the entities take the form of human language words. For example, a “sex” or “gender” code set could contain “MALE” and “FEMALE,” or even “M” and “F” (by convention, we understand what these mean).

For example, a “sex” or “gender” code set could have identifiers “MALE” and “FEMALE,” or even “M” and “F” (by convention, we understand what these mean).
comment: For each given domain, there can potentially exist multiple code sets. The multiplicity of code sets is partially due to the different specific purposes of those code sets.
comment: For National Drug Codes (NDCs) and similar code sets, there doesn’t even have to be a single, fully-concretized copy somewhere (for example, for NDCs there is no centralized database or repository where they all live as one instance of concretization of code set). The code set can be “distributively” concretized. This seems like an unusual exception, but it also likely applies to Universal Product Codes (UPCs) and their follow on Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs).
comment: Many code sets are created for a specific purpose in addition to merely identifying and annotating core ideas of a specified domain.

It leaves open if an organization is a material entity or a dependent continuant, as no consensus was reached on that.  The current placement as material is therefore temporary, in order to move forward with development. Here is the entire email summary, on which the definition is based:\n\n1) there are organization_member_roles (president, treasurer, branch\neditor), with individual persons as bearers\n\n2) there are organization_roles (employer, owner, vendor, patent holder)\n\n3) an organization has a charter / rules / bylaws, which specify what roles\nthere are, how they should be realized, and how to modify the\ncharter/rules/bylaws themselves.\n\nIt is debatable what the organization itself is (some kind of dependent\ncontinuant or an aggregate of people). This also determines who/what the\nbearer of organization_roles' are. My personal favorite is still to define\norganization as a kind of 'legal entity', but thinking it through leads to\nall kinds of questions that are clearly outside the scope of OBI.\n\nInterestingly enough, it does not seem to matter much where we place\norganization itself, as long as we can subclass it (University, Corporation,\nGovernment Agency, Hospital), instantiate it (Affymetrix, NCBI, NIH, ISO,\nW3C, University of Oklahoma), and have it play roles.\n\nThis leads to my proposal: We define organization through the statements 1 -\n3 above, but without an 'is a' statement for now. We can leave it in its\ncurrent place in the is_a hierarchy (material entity) or move it up to\n'continuant'. We leave further clarifications to BFO, and close this issue\nfor now." xsd:string

property_value: IAO:0000112 "PMID: 14744830-Microarrays are powerful tools for surveying the expression levels of many thousands of genes simultaneously. They belong to the new genomics technologies which have important applications in the biological, agricultural and pharmaceutical sciences. There are myriad sources of uncertainty in microarray experiments, and rigorous experimental design is essential for fully realizing the potential of these valuable resources. Two questions frequently asked by biologists on the brink of conducting cDNA or two-colour, spotted microarray experiments are 'Which mRNA samples should be competitively hybridized together on the same slide?' and 'How many times should each slide be replicated?' Early experience has shown that whilst the field of classical experimental design has much to offer this emerging multi-disciplinary area, new approaches which accommodate features specific to the microarray context are needed. In this paper, we propose optimal designs for factorial and time course experiments, which are special designs arising quite frequently in microarray experimentation. Our criterion for optimality is statistical efficiency based on a new notion of admissible designs; our approach enables efficient designs to be selected subject to the information available on the effects of most interest to biologists, the number of arrays available for the experiment, and other resource or practical constraints, including limitations on the amount of mRNA probe. We show that our designs are superior to both the popular reference designs, which are highly inefficient, and to designs incorporating all possible direct pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our proposed designs represent a substantial practical improvement over classical experimental designs which work in terms of standard interactions and main effects. The latter do not provide a basis for meaningful inference on the effects of most interest to biologists, nor make the most efficient use of valuable and limited resources." xsd:string

comment: It is sometimes difficult to define the physical boundaries of a population. In the case of sexually reproducing organisms, the individuals within a population have the potential to reproduce with one another during the course of their lifetimes. 'Community', as often used to describe a group of humans, is a type of population. Classes for population already exist in IDO ('organism population', IDO_0000509) and OBI ('population', OBI_0000181). The definitions should be standardized across ontologies and only one term used.

It is defined by the formula: A = sum(vi*wi)/sum(wi), where 'i' ranges from 1 to n, 'vi' is the value of each observation, and 'wi' is the value of the respective weight for each observed value.\n\nThe weighted arithmetic mean is a kind of mean similar to an ordinary arithmetic mean (the most common type of average), except that instead of each of the data points contributing equally to the final average, some data points are weighted, meaning they contribute more than others. \n\nThe weighted arithmetic mean is often used if one wants to combine average values from samples of the same population with different sample sizes."

Thus if cells of type C1 derive_from cells of type C, then any cell division involving an instance of C1 in a given lineage is preceded_by cellular processes involving an instance of C.    The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
